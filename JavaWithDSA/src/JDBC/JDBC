JDBC:
    1. The process of interacting  with the database from java application called JDBC.
    2. JDBC is an API, which will provide predefined library to connect with database from java application in order to perform the basic database operation
    3. In case of JDBC application we will define the database logic in java application and send a representation database logic to database engine.
    4. But Database engine is unable to execute the java representation database logic so it should required database logic in Query Language representation.
    5. Driver: In the above situation the conversion mechanisms is available in the form of a software called as "Driver".
    6. Database Operation:
                CRUD
                1. Read
                2. Create
                3. Write
                4. Update
                5. Delete
    7. Driver is an interface exist between java application and database to map java API calls to Query language API calls and query language API to java API calls.

Step to design JDBC Application:
    1. Load and Register the driver
    2. Establish the connection between database to java application
    3. Prepare either statement or prepared statement
    4. Write and execute SQL queries
    5. Clone the connection
